### **1. Encryption Fundamentals**

#### **1.1 Key Definitions**
- **Encryption**: Process of converting plaintext ('P') into ciphertext ('C') using a key ('K'). 
  - Encryption: `C = E(K, P)`
  - Decryption: `P = D(K, C)`
- **Symmetric Encryption**:
  - Same key used for both encryption and decryption.
  - Requires secure key exchange between parties.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**:
  - Uses different keys for encryption and decryption (not covered in detail here).

#### **1.2 Why Encryption?**
- Ensures **confidentiality** of data.
- Real-world systems require additional properties like:
  - **Authenticity**
  - **Integrity**
  - **Non-repudiation**

---

### **2. Security Principles**

#### **2.1 Kerckhoffs's Principle**
- The security of a cryptographic system should rely only on the secrecy of the key, not the algorithm.
- Open designs promote scrutiny and reliability.
- All modern cryptographic standards (e.g., AES) adhere to this principle.

#### **2.2 Avoid DIY Cryptography**
- Designing cryptographic systems is complex and error-prone.
- Common pitfalls:
  - Poor design: E.g., A5/2 encryption in 2G networks was broken after 10 years.
  - Weak implementations: Timing attacks or padding oracle attacks can break systems.
  - Implementation bugs: E.g., Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL.

---

### **3. Classical Ciphers**

#### **3.1 Caesar Cipher**
- **Algorithm**:
  - Shift each letter of plaintext by a fixed number.
  - Example: `banana` with a shift of 3 → `edqdqd`.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Small key space (only 26 possible shifts for English).
  - Easily broken via brute force.

#### **3.2 Substitution Cipher**
- **Algorithm**:
  - Replaces each letter with another based on a permutation.
  - Example: `a -> f`, `b -> x`, `c -> z`.
- **Key Space**: `26!` permutations (~88 bits of entropy).
- **Weakness**:
  - Patterns in the plaintext (e.g., letter frequencies) remain visible in the ciphertext.

#### **3.3 Frequency Analysis**
- Exploits the statistical properties of languages.
  - E.g., 'e' is the most common letter in English.
  - Matching ciphertext letter frequencies with expected plaintext frequencies can reveal the key.

#### **3.4 Rotor Machines**
- **Hebern Machine**:
  - A single rotating disk performs substitution.
- **Enigma Machine**:
  - Uses multiple rotors with different rotation speeds.
  - Significantly increased encryption complexity but was broken during WWII due to predictable key patterns.

#### **4.2 Properties**
- **Perfect Security**:
  - Guaranteed if the key is:
    1. Truly random.
    2. Used only once.
- **Limitations**:
  - Key size must equal the message size.
  - Impractical for general use due to key distribution challenges.

### **6. Modes of Operation**

#### **6.1 ECB (Electronic Codebook Mode)**
- Encrypts each block independently.
- **Weakness**:
  - Identical plaintext blocks produce identical ciphertext blocks.
  - Example: Patterns in ECB-encrypted images reveal structure.

#### **6.2 CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**
- Each ciphertext block depends on the previous block and an Initialization Vector (IV).
  - Formula: `C_i = E(K, P_i ⊕ C_{i-1})`

#### **2.3 TLS Architecture**
- **Connections:**
  - Peer-to-peer communication channels that are transient and tied to a specific session.
- **Sessions:**
  - Associations between a client and server, defined by cryptographic parameters (e.g., master secret, cipher suite).
  - Sessions are reusable across multiple connections, reducing handshake overhead.

#### **2.4 Record Protocol Workflow**
1. Application data is fragmented into manageable blocks.
2. Optional compression is applied to reduce data size.
3. A MAC is appended to ensure data integrity.
4. Encrypted data is encapsulated with a TLS record header.
5. Transmitted over TCP; on the receiving end, the process is reversed (decryption, verification, decompression, reassembly).

#### **2.5 Handshake Protocol Stages**
1. **ClientHello:**
   - Client initiates the handshake by sending supported TLS versions, cipher suites, session IDs, and random data.
2. **ServerHello:**
   - Server responds with chosen TLS version, cipher suite, and session ID. Includes a random value for key generation.
3. **Server Certificate:**
   - Server provides its X.509 certificate to authenticate its identity.
4. **Key Exchange:**
   - Server and client exchange cryptographic keys using RSA, Diffie-Hellman, or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).
5. **Finished Message:**
   - Both parties confirm key agreements and start secure communication.

#### **2.6 HTTPS (HTTP over TLS)**
- HTTPS encrypts sensitive elements of HTTP, including:
  - URLs, form data, cookies, and headers.
  - Browser-to-server communications, ensuring secure web transactions.
- Protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and tampering.

### **3. Secure Shell (SSH)**

#### **3.1 Overview**
- SSH establishes a secure, encrypted channel over an insecure network.
- Provides mechanisms to authenticate the remote machine and the user.
- Replaces plaintext protocols like Telnet and rlogin, which are vulnerable to sniffing and spoofing.

#### **3.2 SSH Protocol Architecture**
1. **Transport Layer Protocol:**
   - Ensures confidentiality and integrity of the session using encryption (e.g., AES) and MAC algorithms.
   - Provides server authentication using public key infrastructure (PKI).
2. **User Authentication Protocol:**
   - Supports multiple methods, such as password-based authentication, public key authentication, and host-based authentication.
3. **Connection Protocol:**
   - Multiplexes the encrypted session into multiple logical channels for different operations.

#### **3.3 SSH Authentication Methods**
- **Public Key Authentication:**
  - Relies on asymmetric cryptography, where the client proves its identity by signing data with a private key.
- **Password Authentication:**
  - Client encrypts a plaintext password before transmission to the server.
- **Host-based Authentication:**
  - The client’s host authenticates itself using its private key, enabling trusted access across multiple devices.

#### **3.4 SSH Connection Protocol**
- Logical channels enable diverse tasks within a single session:
  - **Session Channel:** Executes remote commands or provides terminal access.
  - **X11 Channel:** Enables GUI forwarding over SSH.
  - **Port Forwarding:** Secures arbitrary TCP connections (local or remote).

### **4. Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)**

#### **4.1 Overview**
- IPSec operates at the IP layer, ensuring end-to-end security for all IP-based communications.
- Provides mechanisms for encryption, authentication, and replay protection.

#### **4.2 IPSec Components**
1. **Authentication Header (AH):**
   - Protects packet integrity and authenticates the source.
   - Does not encrypt the payload, leaving data readable but verified.
2. **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP):**
   - Encrypts the payload for confidentiality.
   - Includes integrity checks for data and optional header fields.

#### **4.3 IPSec Modes**
- **Transport Mode:**
  - Adds AH/ESP headers directly after the original IP header.
  - Preserves original packet headers, enabling host-to-host communication.
- **Tunnel Mode:**
  - Encapsulates the entire original packet within a new IP header and AH/ESP header.
  - Ideal for gateway-to-gateway VPNs, masking internal network structure.

#### **4.4 Internet Key Exchange (IKE)**
- **Phase 1:**
  - Establishes a secure channel using algorithms like Diffie-Hellman.
  - Negotiates cryptographic parameters and verifies identities.
- **Phase 2:**
  - Establishes IPSec SAs, defining session keys for encryption and MAC operations.

#### **4.5 IPSec Security Architecture**
- **Security Associations (SA):**
  - Unidirectional relationships that define encryption, authentication, and key parameters.
- **Security Policy Database (SPD):**
  - Matches incoming and outgoing traffic to specific SAs based on defined policies.

#### **4.6 Advanced IPSec Features**
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):**
  - Ensures session keys cannot be derived from compromised long-term keys.
- **Replay Protection:**
  - Prevents attackers from reusing captured packets by employing sequence numbers.
- **Dynamic Re-keying:**
  - Periodically updates session keys to minimize risks.
