### **1. Encryption Fundamentals**

#### **1.1 Key Definitions**
- **Encryption**: Process of converting plaintext ('P') into ciphertext ('C') using a key ('K'). 
  - Encryption: `C = E(K, P)`
  - Decryption: `P = D(K, C)`
- **Symmetric Encryption**:
  - Same key used for both encryption and decryption.
  - Requires secure key exchange between parties.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**:
  - Uses different keys for encryption and decryption (not covered in detail here).

#### **1.2 Why Encryption?**
- Ensures **confidentiality** of data.
- Real-world systems require additional properties like:
  - **Authenticity**
  - **Integrity**
  - **Non-repudiation**

---

### **2. Security Principles**

#### **2.1 Kerckhoffs's Principle**
- The security of a cryptographic system should rely only on the secrecy of the key, not the algorithm.
- Open designs promote scrutiny and reliability.
- All modern cryptographic standards (e.g., AES) adhere to this principle.

#### **2.2 Avoid DIY Cryptography**
- Designing cryptographic systems is complex and error-prone.
- Common pitfalls:
  - Poor design: E.g., A5/2 encryption in 2G networks was broken after 10 years.
  - Weak implementations: Timing attacks or padding oracle attacks can break systems.
  - Implementation bugs: E.g., Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL.

---

### **3. Classical Ciphers**

#### **3.1 Caesar Cipher**
- **Algorithm**:
  - Shift each letter of plaintext by a fixed number.
  - Example: `banana` with a shift of 3 → `edqdqd`.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Small key space (only 26 possible shifts for English).
  - Easily broken via brute force.

#### **3.2 Substitution Cipher**
- **Algorithm**:
  - Replaces each letter with another based on a permutation.
  - Example: `a -> f`, `b -> x`, `c -> z`.
- **Key Space**: `26!` permutations (~88 bits of entropy).
- **Weakness**:
  - Patterns in the plaintext (e.g., letter frequencies) remain visible in the ciphertext.

#### **3.3 Frequency Analysis**
- Exploits the statistical properties of languages.
  - E.g., 'e' is the most common letter in English.
  - Matching ciphertext letter frequencies with expected plaintext frequencies can reveal the key.

#### **3.4 Rotor Machines**
- **Hebern Machine**:
  - A single rotating disk performs substitution.
- **Enigma Machine**:
  - Uses multiple rotors with different rotation speeds.
  - Significantly increased encryption complexity but was broken during WWII due to predictable key patterns.

  - Encryption: `C = P ⊕ K`
  - Decryption: `P = C ⊕ K`

#### **4.2 Properties**
- **Perfect Security**:
  - Guaranteed if the key is:
    1. Truly random.
    2. Used only once.
- **Limitations**:
  - Key size must equal the message size.
  - Impractical for general use due to key distribution challenges.

---

### **5. Modern Encryption: Block Ciphers**

#### **5.1 Fundamentals**

  1. **SubBytes**: Non-linear substitution.
  2. **ShiftRows**: Row-wise permutation.
  3. **MixColumns**: Matrix-based diffusion.
  4. **AddRoundKey**: XOR with a subkey.
- **Selected via public competition** (1997-2000 by NIST).

---

### **6. Modes of Operation**

#### **6.1 ECB (Electronic Codebook Mode)**
- Encrypts each block independently.
- **Weakness**:
  - Identical plaintext blocks produce identical ciphertext blocks.
  - Example: Patterns in ECB-encrypted images reveal structure.

#### **6.2 CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**
- Each ciphertext block depends on the previous block and an Initialization Vector (IV).
  - Formula: `C_i = E(K, P_i ⊕ C_{i-1})`
- **Advantages**:
  - Hides plaintext patterns.
- **Weakness**:
  - Requires careful IV management.

#### **6.3 CTR (Counter Mode)**

## Message Authentication Codes (MACs) and Authenticated Encryption (AE) - Comprehensive Study Guide

### **1. Message Authentication Codes (MACs)**

#### **1.1 Definition and Purpose**
- **Definition**: MACs are keyed functions used to ensure message integrity and authenticity in symmetric cryptography.
  - Formula: `t ← MAC(k, m)`
    - `t`: authentication tag.
    - Guarantees the message `m` was created by someone with access to the key `k`.
  - Does not provide confidentiality.

#### **1.2 Applications**
- Common in protocols like **SSH**, **IPSec**, and **TLS**.
- Typical usage:
  1. Sender computes `t ← MAC(k, m)` and sends `(m, t)`.
  2. Receiver recomputes `t' ← MAC(k, m)`.
  3. If `t ≠ t'`, the message is rejected as altered or unauthenticated.

#### **1.3 Security Properties**
- Prevents message tampering.
- Adversaries cannot:
  - Modify `m` without detection.
  - Forge a new message without knowing `k`.

#### **1.4 Construction Methods**
1. **HMAC (Hash-based MAC):**
   - Secure against length extension attacks.
   - Combines a hash function with padding:
     - `H((k ⊕ opad) || H((k ⊕ ipad) || m))`.
2. **CMAC (Cipher-based MAC):**
   - Built from block ciphers like AES in CBC mode.
   - Uses the last ciphertext block as the tag.
3. **Wegman-Carter MAC:**
   - Combines universal hashing with a pseudorandom function (PRF):
     - `t = UH(k1, m) ⊕ PRF(k2, nonce)`.
   - Commonly used in AES-GCM.

---

### **2. Authenticated Encryption (AE)**

#### **2.1 Overview**
- **Goal**: Combine confidentiality (encryption) with authenticity (MAC).
- **AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data):** Extends AE to include integrity checks for additional data (e.g., metadata like sequence numbers).

#### **2.2 Combination Strategies**
1. **Encrypt-and-MAC**:
   - Separately encrypt the message and compute its MAC.
   - Problems:
     - The ciphertext is decrypted before authentication, allowing potential attacks.
2. **MAC-then-Encrypt**:
   - Compute the MAC of the plaintext, then encrypt both the message and tag.
   - Issues:
     - Padding oracle attacks, as seen in older TLS versions (e.g., "Lucky 13").
3. **Encrypt-then-MAC** (preferred):
   - Encrypt the plaintext, then compute the MAC over the ciphertext.
   - Ensures ciphertext is not decrypted unless authenticated.

#### **2.3 Security Advantages**
- Prevents decryption of unauthenticated data.
- Robust against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by early rejection of invalid messages.

  - ChaCha20: Stream cipher for encryption.
  - Poly1305: MAC based on modular arithmetic.
- Highly efficient and resistant to timing attacks.

#### **3.3 Offset Codebook Mode (OCB)**
- Combines offsets and XOR operations with AES:
  - Efficient and secure.
  - Licensing issues limited adoption.
- Handles both plaintext and associated data securely.

#### **3.4 Synthetic IV Mode (SIV)**
- Mitigates nonce-reuse issues by combining encryption and PRFs:
  - `Tag = PRF(k1, a || p || n)`.
  - `Ciphertext = Enc(k2, nonce = Tag, plaintext)`.
- Non-streamable, but robust against nonce misuse.

---

### **4. Key Considerations for AE**

#### **4.1 Nonce Usage**
- Nonces (Initialization Vectors):
  - Must be unique for each encryption.
  - Reusing a nonce compromises confidentiality and integrity (e.g., in OCB).

#### **4.2 Efficiency**
- Modern AE modes prioritize:
  - **Streamability**: Processing data block-by-block without storing the entire message.
  - **Parallelism**: Efficient processing in hardware and software.
  - Example: AES-GCM achieves high throughput in hardware.
